# NinjaMan
A turn based pac-man like game written entirely in Javascript and CSS, featuring an automatic world generator.
This was a CodingDojo pre-course assignment.  I wrote this with very little prior exposure to Javascript, HTML or CSS.  
Recently I updated it to include on screen controls so you can play it on your phone.
